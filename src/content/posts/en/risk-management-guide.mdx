Risk management is not optional—it's the foundation of every successful trading career. Without proper risk controls, even the best strategy will eventually lead to account blow-ups.

## The 1% Rule

**Never risk more than 1-2% of your account on a single trade.**

This simple rule ensures that even a long losing streak won't destroy your account. With 2% risk per trade, you'd need to lose 50 trades in a row to blow your account—extremely unlikely with a solid strategy.

## Position Sizing Formula

```
Position Size = (Account Size × Risk %) ÷ (Entry Price - Stop Loss Price)
```

### Example:
- Account: $100,000
- Risk: 1% ($1,000)
- Entry: $50
- Stop Loss: $49
- Position Size = $1,000 ÷ $1 = 1,000 shares

## Stop-Loss Strategies

### 1. Fixed Percentage Stop
Set stop-loss at a fixed percentage below entry (e.g., 2%)

**Pros:** Simple and consistent  
**Cons:** Ignores market structure

### 2. Technical Stop
Place stop beyond key support/resistance levels

**Pros:** Respects market structure  
**Cons:** May result in larger position size variations

### 3. ATR-Based Stop
Use Average True Range for volatility-adjusted stops

**Pros:** Adapts to market conditions  
**Cons:** Requires calculation

## Advanced Risk Concepts

### Risk-Reward Ratios

Aim for minimum 1:2 risk-reward ratio:
- Risk $100 to make $200+
- Allows profitable trading with 50% win rate

### Portfolio Heat

Total risk across all open positions should not exceed 5-6% of account value.

### Correlation Risk

Avoid taking multiple positions in highly correlated assets—they move together, multiplying your risk.

## Common Risk Management Mistakes

1. **Moving stops to avoid losses** - Never move stop-loss further away
2. **Oversized positions** - "All-in" trades rarely work
3. **Ignoring correlation** - Multiple correlated positions = concentrated risk
4. **No stop-loss** - Hope is not a strategy
5. **Emotional decisions** - Stick to your pre-planned exits

## Building a Risk Management Plan

### Step 1: Define Your Risk Tolerance
- Maximum risk per trade (1-2%)
- Maximum daily loss limit (3-5%)
- Maximum monthly drawdown (10-15%)

### Step 2: Calculate Position Sizes
Use the formula above for every trade

### Step 3: Set Stop-Losses Before Entry
Know your exit before entering

### Step 4: Track Your Risk
Monitor total portfolio exposure

### Step 5: Review and Adjust
Analyze what's working and what's not

## The Math of Survival

With proper risk management:
- 1% risk per trade = 69 consecutive losses to blow account
- 2% risk per trade = 35 consecutive losses needed
- 5% risk per trade = 14 consecutive losses needed

The choice is clear: **smaller risk = longer survival = more chances to profit**.

## Key Takeaways

1. Risk management is more important than strategy
2. Never risk more than 1-2% per trade
3. Use proper position sizing formulas
4. Set stops before entering trades
5. Monitor total portfolio exposure
6. Adapt to changing market conditions
