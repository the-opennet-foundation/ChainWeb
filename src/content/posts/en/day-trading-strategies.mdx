Day trading requires quick decisions, disciplined execution, and proven strategies. Here are the most effective techniques professional day traders use to profit from intraday price movements.

## What is Day Trading?

Day trading involves opening and closing positions within the same trading day. All positions are closed before market close to avoid overnight risk.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Time Frame:** Minutes to hours
- **Positions:** Closed same day
- **Capital:** Higher capital requirements
- **Risk:** Lower overnight risk
- **Intensity:** High focus required

## Top Day Trading Strategies

### 1. Momentum Trading

**Concept:** Trade stocks showing strong directional movement with high volume.

**Entry Signals:**
- Breaking through resistance with volume
- Gap up on significant news
- Strong trending price action

**Exit Strategy:**
- Take profits at key resistance levels
- Exit when momentum weakens
- Use trailing stops to protect gains

**Best For:** Volatile markets with clear trends

### 2. Scalping

**Concept:** Make dozens of small profits throughout the day.

**Key Principles:**
- Hold positions for seconds to minutes
- Target small price movements (0.1-0.5%)
- High win rate required
- Low risk per trade

**Requirements:**
- Fast execution
- Low commission structure
- Tight spreads
- High liquidity markets

**Best For:** Range-bound markets with high liquidity

### 3. Breakout Trading

**Concept:** Enter when price breaks key support/resistance levels.

**Breakout Confirmation:**
- Volume surge on breakout
- Strong close above resistance
- Retests hold as support
- Follow-through on next candle

**False Breakout Protection:**
- Wait for volume confirmation
- Use smaller position size initially
- Scale in after retest

**Best For:** Consolidation patterns and chart formations

### 4. Reversal Trading

**Concept:** Identify and trade market turning points.

**Reversal Signals:**
- Divergence on momentum indicators

**Risk Management:**
- Wider stops due to volatility
- Smaller position sizes
- Quick exits if wrong
- High risk-reward requirement (1:3+)

**Best For:** Experienced traders with strong technical skills

### 5. Gap Trading

**Concept:** Trade the gap between previous close and next open.

**Gap Types:**
- **Full Gap Fill:** Price returns to previous close
- **Partial Gap Fill:** Price fills 50-75% of gap
- **Continuation Gap:** Price runs in gap direction

**Strategy:**
- Fade gaps with no fundamental reason
- Trade with gaps backed by news
- Use 15-30 minute confirmation
- Set stops beyond gap extremes

**Best For:** Morning session (first 30-90 minutes)
